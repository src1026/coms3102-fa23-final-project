# Node.js Note-Taking Application

## Overview
This is a Node.js application for note-taking, using Express for the backend server and MongoDB for data storage. It provides a simple, yet effective way to manage notes.

## Features
- Create, retrieve, and delete notes.
- RESTful API endpoints.
- MongoDB for persistent storage.
- Express server for efficient request handling.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed.
- MongoDB installed and running.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project name]`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `npm start`

## API Endpoints
- **GET /notes**: Retrieve all notes.
- **POST /notes**: Create a new note. Requires a JSON body with note content.
- **DELETE /notes/:id**: Delete a note by its ID.

## Frontend Integration
The frontend of the application, housed in the 'client' folder, is designed to interact seamlessly with the Node.js backend. 
It utilizes HTTP requests to communicate with the server's RESTful API endpoints for managing notes. This includes fetching all notes, 
adding new ones, and deleting existing ones. The frontend dynamically updates the user interface in response to user actions and server responses, 
providing an interactive and real-time experience. 
This integration showcases a typical modern web application structure, where the frontend handles user interaction and display, while the backend manages data processing and storage.
